# Title: Mixed Messages Generator

## Technologies
+ Javascript
+ Git
+ Github

## How does it work
+ 3 arrays are used to store the inspirational talk, the user's star sign and a joke.
+ A function is used to console a random interpolation of the 3 arrays to generate a sensible output.

### Example

** "Ahhh, Welcome "The Virgin", to the Guru Maraji, I know what brings you here and here is my solution for you: Dare to dream big, and then work tirelessly to turn those dreams into reality. and here is a joke to gladen thy heart: What did one wall say to the other wall? I'll meet you at the corner!" **
